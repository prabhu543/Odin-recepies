    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, 
            and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and 
            allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion has 
            softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season 
            with curry powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, ginger, and 
            cayenne pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cooked potatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and tomatoes, then 
            pour in coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking 
            for 5 to 10 minutes.
